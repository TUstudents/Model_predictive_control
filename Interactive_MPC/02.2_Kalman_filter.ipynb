        "*   **Input Excitation:** The quality of the identified model heavily depends on the input signal used for identification. If the input doesn't excite all relevant system dynamics (e.g., if it's too slow or too fast, or doesn't have enough frequency content), the model will be poor.\n",
        "*   **Noise:** Measurement noise can corrupt the identification process. Longer datasets or better signal-to-noise ratios can help.\n",
        "*   **Model Order Selection ($n_a, n_b, n_k$):** Choosing the correct model order is crucial. Underfitting (orders too low) means the model can't capture the dynamics. Overfitting (orders too high) means the model might fit noise and generalize poorly. Information criteria (AIC, BIC) or cross-validation are often used for this.\n",
        "*   **Validation is Key:** Always validate your identified model on a separate dataset (cross-validation) if possible, or using different types of analysis (like step responses, frequency responses, residual analysis) to ensure it's a reasonable representation of the true system before using it for MPC design.\n",
        "*   **State-Space vs. ARX:** While we used ARX for simplicity here, for MPC, a state-space model ($A_{id}, B_{id}, C_{id}, D_{id}$) is usually the desired end product. More advanced identification techniques like Subspace Identification (e.g., N4SID) directly estimate state-space models and are often preferred for MIMO systems.\n",
