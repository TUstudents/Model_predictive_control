        "\n",
        "In the previous notebook (1.2), we successfully formulated the Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) problem as a Quadratic Program (QP) by deriving the matrices $\\mathbf{H}_{QP}$ and $\\mathbf{f}_{QP}$. Now, it's time to solve this QP to find the optimal sequence of future control inputs and then implement the core receding horizon control loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this notebook, we will focus on **unconstrained LMPC**. We'll introduce constraints in Notebook 1.4. This will allow us to concentrate on the QP solution and the basic MPC feedback mechanism first.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goals of this Notebook:**\n",
        "1. Introduce how to solve QPs in Python using libraries like `CVXPY`.\n",
        "2. Implement the unconstrained LMPC receding horizon loop:\n",
        "    a. Obtain the current system state.\n",
        "    b. Formulate and solve the QP to get the optimal control sequence $\\mathbf{U}_k^*$.\n",
        "    c. Apply the first control input $u_{k|k}^*$ from this sequence to a simulated plant.\n",
        "    d. Repeat for a defined simulation duration.\n",
        "3. Visualize the closed-loop performance of the LMPC controller on our double integrator example for a setpoint tracking task.\n",
        "4. Experiment with MPC tuning weights ($\\mathbf{Q}_w, \\mathbf{R}_w, \\mathbf{S}_w$) and observe their impact on performance."
