        "So far in our bioreactor case studies, we've focused on fed-batch operations, where the goal is typically to maximize product at the end of a finite batch. This notebook provides a brief introduction to an alternative and increasingly important mode of operation: **continuous biomanufacturing using perfusion bioreactors**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perfusion systems aim for prolonged, stable operation at high cell densities, continuously feeding fresh media and harvesting product. This offers potential advantages in productivity and product consistency. However, it also presents unique modeling and control challenges.\n",

        "**Goals of this Notebook:**\n",
        "1. Briefly introduce the concepts of continuous biomanufacturing and perfusion systems.\n",
        "2. Define a simplified ODE model for a perfusion bioreactor, including perfusion and bleed rates.\n",
        "3. Discuss the typical control objectives in perfusion systems (e.g., maintaining steady-state Viable Cell Density - VCD).\n",
        "4. Simulate the open-loop behavior of the perfusion model under different operating conditions.\n",
        "5. Conceptually outline how NMPC could be applied to control a perfusion bioreactor.\n",

Fresh medium is continuously added to replenish nutrients and maintain volume.\n",

        "*   Perfusion bioreactors enable continuous biomanufacturing, aiming for stable, high-density cell cultures.\n",
        "*   Control typically involves manipulating perfusion rate ($D_p$) for nutrient/waste environment and bleed rate ($D_b$) for VCD control.\n",
        "*   The modeling approach is similar to fed-batch but accounts for continuous media exchange and cell bleed while volume is often kept constant.\n",
        "*   NMPC can be a powerful tool for achieving and maintaining desired steady states (e.g., target VCD, substrate levels) in the face of disturbances and constraints.\n",
        "*   Long-term stability, filter management, and adapting to biological variability are key challenges in perfusion operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a conceptual introduction. A full NMPC implementation for perfusion would follow similar steps to Notebooks 5.2/5.3 using CasADi, but with the perfusion model and different control objectives/inputs. The next part of the series (**Part 6: Data-Driven Modeling for MPC**) will explore how to build models when first-principles understanding is incomplete."
