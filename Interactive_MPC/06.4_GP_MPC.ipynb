        "In the previous data-driven MPC notebooks, we explored Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This notebook introduces another powerful Bayesian non-parametric approach for modeling system dynamics: **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key advantage of GPs is their inherent ability to provide not only a mean prediction but also a measure of **uncertainty** (variance) associated with that prediction. This uncertainty information can be highly valuable for designing robust MPC controllers, for active learning (deciding where to collect more data), and for risk-aware decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goals of this Notebook:**\n",
        "1.  Understand the basics of Gaussian Processes for regression (mean function, covariance/kernel function).\n",
        "2.  Train a GP model using a Python library (e.g., `GPy` or `GPflow`) to learn the one-step-ahead dynamics of a nonlinear system: $\\hat{x}_{k+1} \\sim \\mathcal{GP}((x_k, u_k))$.\n",
        "3.  Visualize the GP's mean prediction and its confidence intervals.\n",
        "4.  Integrate the GP model's mean function into an NMPC framework using CasADi for prediction.\n",
        "5.  Discuss how the GP's predictive variance could be used conceptually for robust MPC (e.g., chance constraints).\n",
        "6.  Simulate a simple GP-MPC system.\n",
        "7.  Highlight the advantages (uncertainty quantification) and challenges (computational cost, multi-step uncertainty propagation) of GP-MPC."

        "*   **GP Model Quality:** The performance of GP-MPC hinges on the quality of the GP model. Proper kernel selection and hyperparameter optimization are vital.\n",
        "*   **Uncertainty Propagation:** A major challenge in multi-step GP-MPC is propagating the GP's predictive uncertainty through future time steps. The input to the GP at step $k+j$ is the output (a distribution) from step $k+j-1$. This makes the exact posterior distribution over trajectories analytically intractable. Approximations (moment matching, sampling) are typically used.\n",
        "*   **Robustness using Variance:** The GP's predictive variance $\\sigma_{GP}^2(x,u)$ can be used to make the MPC more robust:\n",
        "    *   **Chance Constraints:** $P(g(x_{k+j}, u_{k+j}) \\le 0) \\ge 1 - \\delta$. These can be approximated if $x_{k+j}$ is Gaussian.\n",
        "    *   **Worst-Case Formulation (using bounds):** Constrain $mean_{pred} + \\beta \\cdot std_{pred} \\le y_{max}$, where $\\beta$ controls conservatism.\n",
        "    *   **Modifying Objective:** Penalize high predictive variance in the objective function to steer the system towards regions where the model is more confident.\n",
        "*   **Computational Cost:** Training GPs can be $O(N^3)$ and prediction $O(N^2)$ for $N$ training points. Sparse GP approximations are often necessary for larger datasets to make GP-MPC feasible.\n",
        "*   **Active Learning:** The GP variance can guide data collection. MPC could be designed to occasionally explore regions of high model uncertainty to gather more informative data and improve the GP model online (Exploration vs. Exploitation).\n",
        "\n",
        "While the full implementation of a robust GP-MPC with accurate uncertainty propagation is advanced, this notebook introduces the core idea of using a GP as a learned dynamic model and highlights its unique capability for uncertainty-aware control."

        "*   Integrating GP models (especially from libraries like GPy/GPflow) directly into CasADi for symbolic differentiation by NLP solvers is complex; often numerical calls, finite differences, or symbolic re-implementations/approximations of the GP mean are used.\n",
        "*   The predictive variance from GPs is a key feature that can be exploited for robust MPC design (e.g., chance constraints) or active learning, though this significantly increases complexity.\n",

Each offers unique advantages for tackling complex systems where first-principles models are challenging to obtain.
