    # If ONNXConversion assumes its inputs match the ONNX graph input *after* batching,
    # then casadi_sym_in should probably be (C*H*W, 1) if the Flatten op is handled correctly first.
    # This is where the batch handling assumption is critical.
    # Let's assume the converter expects a CasADi input that matches the "feature part" of the ONNX input
    # for batch_size = 1.
    # For an image (C,H,W), we might pass it as a flattened vector or as a CasADi matrix.
    # The ONNX 'Flatten' op should take care of it internally if correctly converted.
    
    # This test will likely fail with current simple Flatten implementation in ONNXOperations
    # if CasADi input is not already (1, C*H*W) or similar.
    # Let's define casadi_sym_in as what ONNX expects for one sample
    casadi_sym_in_image = ca.SX.sym("image_input_sx", C, H, W) # Not standard for SX direct use.
                                                              # Usually pass flattened or ensure specific shape.

    # This needs careful thought on how ONNXConversion's `convert` expects multi-dim inputs
    # and how `Flatten` op should handle symbolic shapes.
    # For now, this test is more of a placeholder to highlight the challenge.

    # e.g. if Flatten was the first op.

    # We would need to construct an ONNX graph that *starts* with a Flatten op
    # and then feeds into dense layers to test this properly in isolation.
    # Or, modify pytorch_model to take already flattened input for a simpler test of *subsequent* layers.
