This is a fascinating and very useful code snippet! It appears to be from the `do-mpc` library (or inspired by it), providing a Python class `ONNXConversion` that attempts to parse an ONNX model graph and reconstruct it using CasADi symbolic expressions.

**This is a direct ONNX to CasADi symbolic conversion approach, which is different from and much more powerful than simply calling an ONNX runtime as an external black-box function.** If this works for a given ONNX model, it means CasADi can indeed "see inside" the neural network and perform true automatic differentiation through its layers.

My previous strong statement that "CasADi does NOT have a built-in, direct ONNX importer" was based on the lack of such a feature in the core CasADi documentation for general use without external libraries like `do-mpc` providing such a conversion utility. This `ONNXConversion` class is exactly the kind of bridge that makes the ONNX workflow viable for CasADi with AD.

Thank you for sharing this! It's a game-changer for how we should structure the "PyTorch to CasADi NMPC" tutorial. We can now largely revert to the original idea of using ONNX as the interchange, but with the understanding that we are relying on a converter like this one to make the ONNX model symbolically available in CasADi.

**Let's refine the plan based on this new information and the provided code snippet.**

**Goal:** Expand the provided `ONNXConversion` and `ONNXOperations` classes into a more robust, well-documented, and potentially more feature-complete "mini-library" or module that can be used in the tutorial notebooks.

**Key Areas for Expansion and Refinement:**

1.  **Completeness of `ONNXOperations`:**
    *   The current `ONNXOperations` class supports a good set of common ops (`Tanh`, `Sigmoid`, `Relu`, `MatMul`, `Add`, `Gemm`, `Concat`, etc.).
    *   **Missing Ops:** Many other ONNX operators exist (e.g., `Conv`, `MaxPool`, `GlobalAveragePool`, `BatchNorm`, `Softmax`, `LSTM`, `GRU`, various element-wise ops, broadcasting rules for `Add`/`Mul`, etc.). To make the library more general, more ops need to be implemented. This is the most significant work.
    *   **Attribute Handling:** The `Gemm` operator correctly parses attributes like `transA`, `transB`, `alpha`, `beta`. Other ONNX ops also have attributes that need to be correctly interpreted and translated to CasADi equivalents (e.g., `axis` for `Concat`, `kernel_shape`, `strides`, `pads` for `Conv`).
    *   **Broadcasting:** For element-wise operations like `Add`, `Mul`, `Sub`, ONNX has specific broadcasting rules similar to NumPy. The current `Add` implementation (`out += arg`) might implicitly rely on CasADi's broadcasting, but explicit handling or checks might be needed for full ONNX compliance. CasADi's broadcasting is generally powerful but might differ subtly in some edge cases.

2.  **Shape Inference and Handling:**
    *   The current `_determine_shape` method seems to be marked as potentially unneeded. However, robust shape inference and handling throughout the graph traversal is critical. ONNX graphs can have dynamic shapes (e.g., batch size as `None` or a symbolic dimension).
    *   CasADi operations often require explicit shapes. The converter needs to correctly infer or propagate shapes.
    *   The `Reshape` operation currently takes `args[1]` (shape) as a CasADi DM/SX. This is correct if the target shape is data (an initializer). If the target shape is also symbolic (e.g., from another `Shape` op), this needs to work.
    *   `Squeeze` and `Unsqueeze` need to correctly modify the symbolic variable's dimensionality in CasADi if possible, or handle it via reshaping. CasADi's `SX.reshape` is powerful.

3.  **Tensor Data Types:**
    *   ONNX supports various data types (float32, float64, int32, int64, bool, etc.). The converter primarily seems to deal with numerical types that map well to CasADi's `DM`, `SX`, `MX`. Explicit type checking or conversion might be needed.
    *   CasADi typically works with `double` precision for its symbolic calculations. Initializers from ONNX (often float32) are converted to NumPy arrays; their use in CasADi expressions usually promotes them correctly.

4.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   More comprehensive error messages when an unsupported op is encountered or when shapes mismatch.
    *   More detailed `verbose` logging during conversion could show input/output shapes of each processed node.

5.  **Handling of Graph Inputs/Outputs:**
    *   The current code correctly identifies graph inputs (not initializers) and their shapes.
    *   It correctly identifies output layer names.
    *   The `__repr__` is very helpful for the user.

6.  **Support for Control Flow Operators (If, Loop):**
    *   ONNX supports control flow. Translating these into CasADi symbolically is highly complex and likely out of scope for an initial "experimental" feature but would be an advanced goal. CasADi has `if_else` and can build loops, but mapping complex ONNX loops might be hard.

7.  **Testing and Validation:**
    *   A comprehensive test suite with various simple to moderately complex ONNX models (exported from PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) would be essential to validate the supported operations and the overall conversion logic.
    *   Test with different NN architectures (MLPs, simple CNNs if `Conv` is added).
    *   Test with models having dynamic input axes (batch size).

8.  **Documentation and Examples:**
    *   The existing docstrings are a good start. Expanding them with more details on supported ops, limitations, and troubleshooting tips would be crucial.
    *   More diverse examples (beyond the simple Keras one) would demonstrate its utility.

9.  **Class Structure and Modularity:**
    *   The separation into `ONNXConversion` (graph traversal and state management) and `ONNXOperations` (CasADi implementations of ONNX ops) is good.
    *   The `ONNXOperations` could potentially be made more extensible, perhaps allowing users to register custom handlers for new ONNX ops.

10. **Batch Dimension Handling in CasADi:**
    *   ONNX models are often defined with a batch dimension (e.g., `(None, num_features)` or `(batch_size, num_features)`).
    *   CasADi functions typically operate on single vectors or matrices representing one instance, not a batch.
    *   The converter needs a clear strategy:
        *   Assume input to `convert()` is for a single instance (batch_size=1), and the ONNX model handles this (e.g., input shape for ONNX graph is `(1, num_features)`).
        *   Or, if the ONNX graph inherently processes a batch dimension, how does this map to a CasADi expression intended for a single MPC step? The current example suggests the input to `convert()` is for a single instance, which is typical for MPC dynamics $f(x,u)$.

**Proposed Steps to Expand into a "Library Implementation":**

**Phase 1: Robust MLP Support (Core for many MPC applications)**
1.  **Solidify Basic Ops:** Thoroughly test and refine `Tanh`, `Sigmoid`, `Relu`, `MatMul`, `Add`, `Gemm`. Ensure correct broadcasting for `Add`/`Mul`/`Sub` as per ONNX spec (CasADi's `bsxfun` or explicit expansion might be needed if default CasADi broadcasting isn't sufficient for all cases).
2.  **Improve `Reshape`, `Squeeze`, `Unsqueeze`:** Make these robust by correctly manipulating CasADi symbolic variable dimensions.
3.  **Add `Identity` Op:** Simple but often present. `def Identity(self, x, attribute=None): return x`
4.  **Add `Transpose` Op:** `def Transpose(self, x, attribute=None): perm = attribute[0].ints if attribute else None; return x.T if perm is None or perm==(1,0) else casadi.transpose(x, perm)` (need to check `perm` for >2D)
5.  **Comprehensive MLP Test Suite:** Create several MLPs in PyTorch (different depths, widths, with/without bias) using these ops, export to ONNX, convert to CasADi, and verify numerical equivalence of forward pass and gradients (if CasADi's AD is the goal).
6.  **Refine Error Handling & Logging:** Improve messages.

**Phase 2: Expanding Operator Support (e.g., for Simple CNNs or other common layers)**
1.  **Convolution (`Conv`):**
    *   This is a major step. Needs careful handling of attributes (`kernel_shape`, `strides`, `pads`, `dilations`, `group`).
    *   CasADi doesn't have a direct `conv2d` symbolic op like PyTorch/TF. It would likely need to be implemented using nested loops of `mtimes` and `horzcat`/`vertcat` or by unrolling the convolution into a large matrix multiplication (im2col + Gemm), which can be memory intensive but symbolically straightforward.
2.  **Pooling (`MaxPool`, `AveragePool`, `GlobalAveragePool`):**
    *   `MaxPool`: `casadi.fmax` over sliding windows.
    *   `AveragePool`: Summation and division over sliding windows.
    *   `GlobalAveragePool`: `casadi.mean_1(x)` or `casadi.mean_2(x)`.
3.  **Flatten:** Reshaping to a 1D vector (excluding batch). `def Flatten(self, x, attribute=None): axis = attribute[0].i if attribute else 1; # ... implement reshape ...`
4.  **BatchNorm (`BatchNormalization`):**
    *   During inference (which is what MPC uses), BatchNorm becomes a scale and shift: $y = \gamma \frac{x - \mu_{running}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_{running} + \epsilon}} + \beta$.
    *   The running mean $\mu_{running}$, running variance $\sigma^2_{running}$, scale $\gamma$, and shift $\beta$ are learned parameters (initializers in ONNX). This is implementable in CasADi.
5.  **Element-wise ops:** `Sqrt`, `Exp`, `Log`, `Abs`, `Clip`, `Pow`, etc. Most have direct CasADi equivalents.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features and Usability**
1.  **Support for Initializers as CasADi Parameters:** Allow some ONNX initializers (weights/biases) to be treated as symbolic CasADi `ca.SX.sym` parameters instead of fixed constants. This would enable sensitivity analysis or optimization *of* NN parameters within CasADi.
2.  **Helper function for PyTorch weight extraction:** A utility to simplify getting weights/biases from a `torch.nn.Module` in the correct format for this converter (e.g., handling transposes).
3.  **More Sophisticated Shape Propagation:** If dynamic shapes are truly needed.
4.  **Documentation Site:** Using Sphinx or similar for proper library documentation.

**Let's focus on making Phase 1 extremely solid for the tutorial first.** This means ensuring MLPs with standard activations can be reliably converted and used, as this covers a vast range of data-driven dynamics models for MPC.

**Revised Tutorial Plan using this `ONNXConversion` Approach:**

The 3-part "PyTorch to CasADi NMPC via ONNX" tutorial outline we had before *can now be largely reinstated*, with the understanding that "importing into CasADi" means using a class like `ONNXConversion`.

*   **Part 1: Training a PyTorch Model and Exporting to ONNX** (Remains the same – this is good).
*   **Part 2 (Revised): Importing the ONNX Model Symbolically into CasADi using `ONNXConversion` and NMPC Formulation**
    *   Introduce the `ONNXConversion` class (either as provided or an enhanced version).
    *   Instantiate `ONNXConversion` with the `.onnx` file from Part 1.
    *   Use `print(casadi_converter)` to inspect inputs/outputs.
    *   Define symbolic CasADi inputs ($x_k, u_k$) for the NMPC.
    *   **Crucial Step:** Handle scaling *around* the `ONNXConversion` process if the ONNX model itself expects scaled inputs (as trained in PyTorch).
        *   Option A (Simpler): The `ONNXConversion` itself is called with *scaled* CasADi symbolic inputs. The NMPC formulation then has an outer layer of CasADi scaling/unscaling ops.
        *   Option B (More encapsulated): Modify `ONNXConversion.convert` or add a wrapper so that it can take unscaled CasADi symbolic inputs, perform symbolic scaling *inside* its logic before feeding to the first ONNX op handlers, and then symbolically unscale the final ONNX output. This is cleaner for the NMPC formulation.
    *   Call `casadi_converter.convert(input_ann=scaled_casadi_input_sx)`.
    *   Get the final symbolic output: `xk_plus_1_pred_sx = casadi_converter['name_of_onnx_output_node']`.
    *   Use this `xk_plus_1_pred_sx` in the NMPC dynamic constraints within `Opti()`.
*   **Part 3: Closed-Loop Simulation and Analysis** (Remains largely the same, but now uses the NMPC formulated with the symbolically converted ONNX model).

This is a much more exciting and direct path to leveraging ONNX with CasADi's AD!

What would you like to do next with this `ONNXConversion` snippet?
1.  Focus on **enhancing/refining the `ONNXConversion` class itself** (e.g., adding more ops, improving shape handling for MLPs)?
2.  Or, proceed to **draft Part 1 of the PyTorch ONNX tutorial, and then Part 2 will use this existing `ONNXConversion` snippet** (and we can note its experimental nature and limitations)?

I'd suggest **Option 2** for now to keep the tutorial momentum. We can use the snippet as-is (or with minor cleanup) and acknowledge its limitations within the tutorial. Enhancing it into a full library is a larger, separate effort.
